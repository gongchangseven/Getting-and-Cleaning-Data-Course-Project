Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
* From the data set in last step, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
